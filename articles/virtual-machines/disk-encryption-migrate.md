# Migrate from Azure Disk Encryption to encryption at host

[!INCLUDE [Azure Disk Encryption retirement notice](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/security/azure-disk-encryption-retirement.md)]

This article provides step-by-step guidance for migrating your virtual machines from Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) to encryption at host. The migration process requires creating new disks and VMs, as in-place conversion is not supported.

## Migration overview

Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) encrypts data within the VM using BitLocker (Windows) or dm-crypt (Linux), while encryption at host encrypts data at the VM host level without consuming VM CPU resources. Encryption at host enhances Azure's default server-side encryption (SSE) by providing end-to-end encryption for all VM data, including temp disks, caches, and data flows between compute and storage.

For more information, see [Overview of managed disk encryption options](/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview) and [Enable end-to-end encryption using encryption at host](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-portal).

### Migration limitations and considerations

Before starting the migration process, be aware of these important limitations and considerations that affect your migration strategy:

- **No in-place migration**: You cannot directly convert ADE-encrypted disks to encryption at host. Migration requires creating new disks and VMs.

- **Linux OS disk limitation**: Disabling ADE on Linux OS disks is not supported. For Linux VMs with ADE-encrypted OS disks, you must create a new VM with a new OS disk.

- **Windows ADE encryption patterns**: On Windows VMs, Azure Disk Encryption can only encrypt the OS disk alone OR all disks (OS + data disks). It's not possible to encrypt only data disks on Windows VMs.

- **UDE flag persistence**: Disks encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption have a Unified Data Encryption (UDE) flag that persists even after decryption. Both snapshots and disk copies using the Copy option retain this UDE flag. The migration requires creating new managed disks using the Upload method and copying the VHD blob data, which creates a new disk object without any metadata from the source disk.

- **Downtime required**: The migration process requires VM downtime for disk operations and VM recreation.

- **Domain-joined VMs**: If your VMs are part of an Active Directory domain, more steps are required:
  - The original VM must be removed from the domain before deletion
  - After creating the new VM, it must be rejoined to the domain
  - For Linux VMs, domain joining can be accomplished using Azure AD extensions

  For more information, see [What is Microsoft Entra Domain Services?](/entra/identity/domain-services/overview)

### Prerequisites

Before starting the migration:

1. **Backup your data**: Create backups of all critical data before beginning the migration process.

1. **Test the process**: If possible, test the migration process on a nonproduction VM first.

1. **Prepare encryption resources**: Ensure your VM size supports encryption at host. Most current VM sizes support this feature. For more information about VM size requirements, see [Enable end-to-end encryption using encryption at host](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-portal).

1. **Document configuration**: Record your current VM configuration, including network settings, extensions, and attached resources.

## Migration steps

The following migration steps work for most scenarios, with specific differences noted for each operating system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Linux VMs with encrypted OS disks cannot be decrypted in-place. For these VMs, you must create a new VM with a new OS disk and migrate your data. See the [Migrating Linux VMs with encrypted OS disks](#migrating-linux-vms-with-encrypted-os-disks) section after reviewing the general process below.

### Disable Azure Disk Encryption

First step is to disable the existing Azure Disk Encryption when possible:

- **Windows**: Follow the instructions in [Disable encryption and remove the encryption extension on Windows](windows/disk-encryption-windows.md#disable-encryption-and-remove-the-encryption-extension)
- **Linux**: If **only data disks** are encrypted, follow [Disable encryption and remove the encryption extension on Linux](linux/disk-encryption-linux.md#disable-encryption-and-remove-the-encryption-extension). If **the OS disk is encrypted**, see the [Migrating Linux VMs with encrypted OS disks](#migrating-linux-vms-with-encrypted-os-disks).

After running the ADE disable command, the VM encryption status in the Azure portal changes to "SSE + PMK" immediately. However, the actual decryption process at the OS level takes time and depends on the amount of data encrypted. You must verify that OS-level decryption is completed before proceeding to the next step.

**For Windows VMs:**
- Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: `manage-bde -status`
- Verify that all volumes show "Fully Decrypted" status
- The decryption percentage should show 100% for all encrypted volumes

**For Linux VMs (data disks only):**
- Run: `sudo cryptsetup status /dev/mapper/<device-name>`
- Verify that encrypted devices are no longer active
- Check with: `lsblk` to confirm no encrypted mappings remain

Wait for complete decryption before continuing with disk migration to ensure data integrity.

### Create new managed disks

Create new disks that don't carry over the ADE encryption metadata. This process works for both Windows and Linux VMs, with some specific considerations for Linux OS disks.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli
# Get the source disk ID
SOURCE_DISK_ID=$(az disk show --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" --name "MySourceDisk" --query "id" -o tsv)

# Create a new disk from the source disk
az disk create --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" --name "MyTargetDisk" 
  --source "$SOURCE_DISK_ID" --upload-type "Copy"

# For OS disks, specify --os-type "Linux" or --os-type "Windows"
```

> [!NOTE]
> This method creates new disks without the Azure Disk Encryption metadata (UDE flag), which is essential for a clean migration.
>
> **Important**: When copying a managed disk from Azure, add 512 bytes to the disk size to account for the footer that Azure omits when reporting disk size.

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell)

```azurepowershell
# Get source disk information
$sourceDisk = Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName "MySourceDisk"

# Create a new empty target disk
# For Windows OS disks
$diskConfig = New-AzDiskConfig -Location $sourceDisk.Location -CreateOption Upload `
  -UploadSizeInBytes $($sourceDisk.DiskSizeBytes+512) -OsType Windows `
  -HyperVGeneration "V2"

# For Linux OS disks (if not ADE-encrypted)
# $diskConfig = New-AzDiskConfig -Location $sourceDisk.Location -CreateOption Upload `
#   -UploadSizeInBytes $($sourceDisk.DiskSizeBytes+512) -OsType Linux `
#   -HyperVGeneration "V2"

# For data disks (no OS type needed)
# $diskConfig = New-AzDiskConfig -Location $sourceDisk.Location -CreateOption Upload `
#   -UploadSizeInBytes $($sourceDisk.DiskSizeBytes+512)

$targetDisk = New-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName "MyTargetDisk" -Disk $diskConfig

# Generate SAS URIs and copy the data
# Get SAS URIs for both disks
$sourceSAS = Grant-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName $sourceDisk.Name `
  -Access Read -DurationInSecond 7200
$targetSAS = Grant-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName $targetDisk.Name `
  -Access Write -DurationInSecond 7200

# Copy the disk data using AzCopy
azcopy copy $sourceSAS.AccessSAS $targetSAS.AccessSAS --blob-type PageBlob

# Revoke SAS access when complete
Revoke-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName $sourceDisk.Name
Revoke-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName $targetDisk.Name
```

### Create a new VM with encryption

Create a new VM using the newly created disks with your chosen encryption method.

You can choose from several encryption options, depending on your security requirements. This article provides steps for creating a new VM with encryption at host, which is the most common migration path. Other encryption options are covered in [Overview of managed disk encryption options](/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview).

#### Create a new VM with encryption at host

Encryption at host provides the closest equivalent to Azure Disk Encryption's coverage, and is covered in this section.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI2)

**For OS disks:**

```azurecli
# For Windows OS disks
az vm create 
  --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" 
  --name "MyVM-New" 
  --os-type "Windows" 
  --attach-os-disk "MyTargetDisk" 
  --encryption-at-host true

# For Linux OS disks
# az vm create 
#   --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" 
#   --name "MyVM-New" 
#   --os-type "Linux" 
#   --attach-os-disk "MyTargetDisk" 
#   --encryption-at-host true
```

**For data disks:**

```azurecli
# Enable encryption at host on the VM
az vm update 
  --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" 
  --name "MyVM-New" 
  --encryption-at-host true

# Attach the newly created data disk
az vm disk attach 
  --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" 
  --vm-name "MyVM-New" 
  --name "MyTargetDisk"
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell2)

**For OS disks:**

```azurepowershell
# Define VM configuration
$vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName "MyVM-New" -VMSize "Standard_D2s_v3"

# Add the OS disk (Windows example)
$vmConfig = Set-AzVMOSDisk -VM $vmConfig -ManagedDiskId $targetDisk.Id -CreateOption Attach -Windows

# For Linux OS disk, use -Linux instead of -Windows

# Enable encryption at host
$vmConfig = Set-AzVMSecurityProfile -VM $vmConfig -EncryptionAtHost $true

# Create the VM with network settings (you'll need to specify your own)
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Location $targetDisk.Location -VM $vmConfig
```

**For data disks:**

```azurepowershell
# Get the VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "MyVM-New"

# Attach the data disk
$vm = Add-AzVMDataDisk -VM $vm -ManagedDiskId $targetDisk.Id -Lun 0 -CreateOption Attach

# Update the VM
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -VM $vm
```

---

### Verify and configure the new disks

After creating the new VM with encryption at host, you need to verify and configure the disks properly for your operating system.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI3)

**For Windows VMs:**

- Verify disk letters are assigned correctly
- Check that applications can access the disks correctly
- Update any applications or scripts that reference specific disk IDs

**For Linux VMs:**

- Update `/etc/fstab` with the new disk UUIDs
- Mount the data disks to the correct mount points

```bash
# Get UUIDs of all disks
sudo blkid

# Mount all disks defined in fstab
sudo mount -a
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell3)

**For Windows VMs:**

- Verify disk letters are assigned correctly using disk management or PowerShell
- Check that applications can access the disks correctly

```powershell
# List all disks and their partitions
Get-Disk | Get-Partition | Format-Table -AutoSize

# Check drive letters
Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem
```

**For Linux VMs:**

- You need to connect to the Linux VM via SSH to perform these tasks, but PowerShell can be used to verify the VM is running:

```powershell
# Verify VM is running
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "MyVM-New" -Status
```

---

Both Windows and Linux may require additional configuration steps specific to your applications or workloads.

### Verify encryption and cleanup

Verify that encryption at host is properly configured on both Windows and Linux VMs.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI4)

```azurecli
# Check encryption at host status
az vm show --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" --name "MyVM-New" --query "securityProfile.encryptionAtHost"
```

After confirming that encryption at host is working properly:

1. Test VM functionality to ensure applications work correctly
2. Verify that data is accessible and intact
3. Delete the original resources when you're satisfied with the migration:

```azurecli
# Delete the original VM
az vm delete --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" --name "MyVM-Original" --yes

# Delete the original disk
az disk delete --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" --name "MySourceDisk" --yes
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell4)

```azurepowershell
# Check encryption at host status
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "MyVM-New" | `
Select-Object -ExpandProperty SecurityProfile | Select-Object EncryptionAtHost

# Verify disk encryption status
Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName "MyTargetDisk" | Select-Object Name, Encryption
```

After confirming that encryption at host is working properly:

1. Test VM functionality to ensure applications work correctly
2. Verify that data is accessible and intact
3. Delete the original resources when you're satisfied with the migration:

```azurepowershell
# Delete the original VM
Remove-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "MyVM-Original" -Force

# Delete the original disk
Remove-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName "MySourceDisk" -Force
```

---

## Migrating Linux VMs with encrypted OS disks

Since you cannot disable encryption on Linux OS disks, the process is different from Windows.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI5)

1. Create a new VM with encryption at host enabled

   ```azurecli
   az vm create \
     --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" \
     --name "MyVM-New" \
     --image "Ubuntu2204" \
     --encryption-at-host true \
     --admin-username "azureuser" \
     --generate-ssh-keys
   ```

2. For data migration options:
   - For application data: Use SCP, rsync, or other file transfer methods to copy data
   - For configuration: Replicate important configuration files and settings
   - For complex applications: Use backup/restore procedures appropriate for your applications

   ```azurecli
   # Example of using SCP to copy files from source to new VM
   az vm run-command invoke -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVM-Original --command-id RunShellScript \
     --scripts "scp -r /path/to/data azureuser@new-vm-ip:/path/to/destination"
   ```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell5)

1. Create a new VM with encryption at host enabled

   ```azurepowershell
   # Create a new VM with encryption at host
   $vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName "MyVM-New" -VMSize "Standard_D2s_v3" | 
     Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Linux -ComputerName "MyVM-New" -Credential (Get-Credential) |
     Set-AzVMSourceImage -PublisherName "Canonical" -Offer "UbuntuServer" -Skus "18.04-LTS" -Version "latest" |
     Set-AzVMSecurityProfile -EncryptionAtHost $true

   # Add networking and create the VM
   New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS" -VM $vmConfig
   ```

2. For data migration options:
   - For application data: Use PowerShell remoting or scripts to copy data
   - For configuration: Replicate important configuration files and settings
   - For complex applications: Use backup/restore procedures appropriate for your applications

---

After creating the new VM:

1. Configure the new VM to match the original environment
   - Set up the same network configurations
   - Install the same applications and services
   - Apply the same security settings

2. Test thoroughly before decommissioning the original VM

This approach works for both Windows and Linux VMs, but is especially important for Linux VMs with encrypted OS disks that cannot be decrypted in-place.

For guidance on data migration, see [Upload a VHD to Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disks-upload-vhd-to-managed-disk-cli) and [Copy files to a Linux VM using SCP](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/copy-files-to-linux-vm-using-scp).

## Domain-joined VM considerations

If your VMs are members of an Active Directory domain, additional steps are required during the migration process:

### Premigration domain steps

1. **Document domain membership**: Record the current domain, organizational unit (OU), and any special group memberships
2. **Note computer account**: The computer account in Active Directory needs to be managed
3. **Backup domain-specific configurations**: Save any domain-specific settings, group policies, or certificates

### Domain removal process

1. **Remove from domain**: Before deleting the original VM, remove it from the domain using one of these methods:
   - Use `Remove-Computer` PowerShell cmdlet on Windows
   - Use the System Properties dialog to change to workgroup
   - Manually delete the computer account from Active Directory Users and Computers

2. **Clean up Active Directory**: Remove any orphaned computer accounts or DNS entries

### Post-migration domain rejoining

1. **Join new VM to domain**: After creating the new VM with encryption at host:
   - For Windows: Use `Add-Computer` PowerShell cmdlet or System Properties
   - For Linux: Use Azure AD domain join extension or manual configuration

2. **Restore domain settings**: Reapply any domain-specific configurations, group policies, or certificates

3. **Verify domain functionality**: Test domain authentication, group policy application, and network resource access

### Linux domain joining

For Linux VMs, you can use the Azure AD Domain Services VM extension:

```azurecli
az vm extension set \
    --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" \
    --vm-name "MyLinuxVM-New" \
    --name "AADSSHLoginForLinux" \
    --publisher "Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory"
```

For more information, see [What is Microsoft Entra Domain Services?](/entra/identity/domain-services/overview)

### Important domain considerations

- The new VM has a different computer SID, which may affect some applications
- Kerberos tickets and cached credentials must be refreshed
- Some domain-integrated applications may require reconfiguration
- Plan for potential temporary loss of domain services during migration

## Post-migration verification

After completing the migration, verify that encryption at host is working correctly:

1. **Check encryption at host status**: Verify that encryption at host is enabled:

   ```azurecli
   az vm show --resource-group "MyResourceGroup" --name "MyVM-New" --query "securityProfile.encryptionAtHost"
   ```

2. **Test VM functionality**: Ensure your applications and services are working correctly.

3. **Verify disk encryption**: Confirm that disks are properly encrypted:

   ```azurepowershell
   Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -DiskName "MyVM-OS-New" | Select-Object Name, DiskState
   ```

4. **Monitor performance**: Compare performance before and after migration to confirm the expected improvements.

For more information about encryption verification, see [Enable end-to-end encryption using encryption at host](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-portal).

## Cleanup

After successful migration and verification:

1. **Delete old VM**: Remove the original ADE-encrypted VM
2. **Delete old disks**: Remove the original encrypted disks
3. **Update Key Vault access policies**: Other disk encryption solutions use standard Key Vault authorization mechanisms. If you no longer need the Key Vault for Azure Disk Encryption, update its access policies to disable the special disk encryption setting:

   # [CLI](#tab/CLI-cleanup)

   ```azurecli
   az keyvault update --name "YourKeyVaultName" --resource-group "YourResourceGroup" --enabled-for-disk-encryption false
   ```

   # [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell-cleanup)

   ```azurepowershell
   Update-AzKeyVault -VaultName "YourKeyVaultName" -ResourceGroupName "YourResourceGroup" -EnabledForDiskEncryption $false
   ```

   ---

4. **Clean up resources**: Remove any temporary resources created during migration
5. **Update documentation**: Update your infrastructure documentation to reflect the migration to encryption at host

## Common issues and solutions

### VM size doesn't support encryption at host

**Solution**: Check the [list of supported VM sizes](disk-encryption.md#encryption-at-host---end-to-end-encryption-for-your-vm-data) and resize your VM if necessary

### VM fails to start after migration

**Solution**: Check that all disks are properly attached and that the OS disk is set as the boot disk

### Encryption at host not enabled

**Solution**: Verify that the VM was created with the `--encryption-at-host true` parameter and that your subscription supports this feature

### Performance issues persist

**Solution**: Verify that encryption at host is properly enabled and that the VM size supports the expected performance.
